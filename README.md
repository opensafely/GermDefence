# GermDefence

This is the code and configuration for the Germ Defence project. Germ Defence (www.germdefence.org) is an evidence-based interactive website that provides advice for infection control within households. This intervention was implemented rapidly and at scale via efficient trial deisgn to maximise the potential to effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19. This is the first RCT to be conducted using the OpenSAFELY platform.

* The paper is [here]()
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
